    "# Some Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have mostly been making pictures of our data. This is always a vital step when we analyze data -- pictures communicate a great deal of information. However, we also want to quantify our data in various ways -- we want numbers that we can use to describe qualities of our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Measures of Central Tendency\n",
    "\n",
    "We often want to describe the \"middle\" of our data. There are several well known measures-- which you probably learned in elementary school -- to describe the \"middle\". The two we will use the most are the **mean** and the **median**.\n",
    "#### mean:\n",
    "- We often denote the mean with the lower-case greek letter mu, $\\mu$, or with a line over a variable $\\bar{x}$\n",
    "- To find the mean, add up the values of all of our data points and then divide by the number of data points.\n",
    "- Symbolically, if we denote our data points as $x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots ,x_{n-1} ,x_n$, the mean is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{x}=\\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + \\cdots + x_{n-1} + x_n}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example -- Let our data be the height, in inches, of ten people: 61, 63, 65, 67, 70, 67, 69, 70, 71, 73. Then our mean, $\\mu$, is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu=\\frac{61 + 63 + 65 + 67 + 70 + 67 + 69 + 70 + 71 + 73}{10} = \\frac{676}{10} = 67.6 \\textrm{ inches}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### median:\n",
    "- To find the median, we put our data values in order from highest to lowest. If there are an even number of data points our median is the mean of the middle two points. If there are an odd number of values our median is the middle value.\n",
    "- Example using the same height data as above --  61, 63, 65, 67, 70, 67, 69, 70, 71, 73:\n",
    "    1. First sort the data: 61, 63, 65, 67, 67, 69, 70, 70, 71, 73\n",
    "    2. There are ten data points, so we need to take the average of the middle two.\n",
    "    3. The middle two values are 67 and 69 so \n",
    "    \n",
    "    $$\\textrm{median} = \\frac{67 + 69}{2} = 68 \\textrm{ inches}$$\n",

    "## Quantiles/Percentiles\n",
    "It is often useful to quantify other points in our data besides the middle. For this we use quantiles or percentiles -- they are basically the same thing one uses a decimal, the other uses a percent. A quantile (or percentile) gives the value where a given ratio (or percent) of our data is below that value.\n",
    "- Example with the height data above -- 61, 63, 65, 67, 67, 69, 70, 70, 71, 73:\n",
    "  1. The 0.3 quantile (or 30th percentile) is between 65 and 67, because 3 out of 10 (or 0.3 or 30%) of our data is below that value. There are several ways to pick the value between 65 and 67.\n",
    "  2. The natural choice would be the  mean of 65 and 67 -- which is 66 -- but our python tools will use a different method by default and will return 66.4 . The exact method is not too important and wither of these values are fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common quantiles we use are 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 (the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles). These split our data into quarters so we call them the first, second, and third quartiles.  Notice that the median is just another name for the 0.5 quantile. \n",

   "source": [
    "## The Spread of our data\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important thing to measure is how spread out our data is. The simplest measure is the **range**, which is simply the difference between the largest and smallest data points. Other common measures of spread are the **variance**, the **standard deviation**, and the **inter-quartile range** or **IQR**. \n",
    "#### Variance:\n",
    "- We often denote the variance with the square of thelower-case Greek letter sigma, $\\sigma^2$\n",
    "- To find the variance, for each data point we subtract the mean from the data point and square that difference. We then add all of those squared differences together and divide by the number of points.\n",
    "- Symbolically, if we denote our data points as $x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots ,x_{n-1} ,x_n$, and they have mean $\\bar{x}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma^2=\\frac{(x_1-\\bar{x}) + (x_2-\\bar{x}) + (x_3-\\bar{x})+ \\cdots + (x_{n-1}-\\bar{x}) + (x_n-\\bar{x})}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Again -- Let our data be the height, in inches, of ten people: 61, 63, 65, 67, 70, 67, 69, 70, 71, 73. We know the mean is 67.6 inches. Then our variance, $\\sigma^2$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\\sigma^2&=\\frac{(61-67.6)^2 + (63-67.6)^2 + (65-67.6)^2 + \\cdots + (71-67.6)^2 + (73-67.6)^2}{10}\\\\ \\\\\n",
    "&=\\frac{(-6.6)^2 + (-4.6)^2 + (-2.6)^2 + \\cdots + (3.4)^2 + (5.4)^2}{10}\\\\ \\\\\n",
    "&=\\frac{43.56 + 21.16 + 6.76 + \\cdots + 11.56 + 29.16}{10}\\\\ \\\\\n",
    "&=\\frac{126.4}{10}\\\\ \\\\\n",
    "&=12.64\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard Deviation:\n",
    "- We denote the standard deviation with  the lower-case Greek letter sigma, $\\sigma$.\n",
    "- To find the standard deviation, we just take the square root of our variance.\n",
    "- So the standard deviation, $\\sigma$, is given by:\n",
    "$$\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2} \\\\ $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- In our example our variance is 12.64, so our standard deviation is $\\sqrt{12.64}=3.56 \\textrm{ inches}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inter-quartile range\n",
    "- We often use the abbreviation IQR for the inter-quartile range\n",
    "- To find the IQR we calculate the difference between the third (0.75) and first (0.25) quartiles.\n",
    "- In our hight example our first quartile is  65.5 and our third quartile is 70. So:\n",
    "$$\\begin{align} \\textrm{IQR} &= (\\textrm{first quartile}) - (\\textrm{third quartile}) \\\\\n",
    "&= 70 - 65.5 \\\\\n",
    "&= 4.5 \\\\ \\end{align} $$"
