So if we want to use a web-based map or if we want to use some other maps for choropleths we must supply our own 'geometry' (the shapes that are colored in - like the U.S. states or countries). Some other common regions we might want to use for choropleths are states/provinces of other countries, city boundaries,neighborhoods, zip codes, counties, voting districts, etc.\n",
